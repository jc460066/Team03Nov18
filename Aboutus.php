							<strong>Junior Training Squad</strong><br>
							Brisbane Volleyball Club runs a Junior Training Squad for each term of the school year. The JTS program allows high school aged male and female athletes to get extra training outside of their school teams with a specific focus on skill development. Whilst many athletes in these squads play in school teams, this squad is also open to new players who do not have school teams as well.
